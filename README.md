# Space-Shooter-using-OpenGL

# 1.	Introduction to Project	
Game Space Shooter is an action-packed arcade-style video game set in space, where the player controls a spaceship and battles against waves of enemy spacecraft. The game involves navigating through space, dodging enemy fire, and shooting down enemy spaceships.

The game was first introduced in the early days of gaming and gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. The genre has since evolved with advancements in technology, providing a more immersive gaming experience with improved graphics, sound effects, and gameplay mechanics.

This project aims to replicate the classic space shooter game with simple OpenGL and C++ concepts. The player will have control of their spaceship's movements and weapons as they take on enemy spacecraft, aiming to survive each wave and progress through increasingly difficult levels. The game will be designed to provide a challenging and engaging experience for players, with a range of power-ups and obstacles to keep things interesting.

# 2.	Computer Graphics concepts used	
In our project, various computer graphics concepts are employed. The key concepts used in this project are:

1. 2D Graphics Rendering: In this project, 2D graphics rendering is used to create a
graphical representation of the aliens and spaceships.

2. OpenGL: OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform graphics API used
for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. In this project, OpenGL functions are employed
to make the aliens and spaceships viewable.

3. GLFW/GLEW: GLFW provides a lightweight cross-platform API for creating
and managing OpenGL contexts and handling input, while GLEW simplifies the
process of loading and using OpenGL extensions in a cross-platform manner.

4. Coordinate System and Transformations: The project utilizes a Cartesian coordinate system to position the spaceships on the screen. The spaceships are represented by their (x, y) coordinates and their state is updated by modifying their coordinates based on the current state of the system. OpenGL transformation functions such as glMatrixMode, glLoadIdentity, and glOrtho are employed to establish the coordinate system and guarantee accurate display of the aliens and spaceships on the screen.

5. Animation and Game Loop: The game loop is an essential component of the
project, responsible for updating the game state and rendering the graphics. The
game loop is implemented using OpenGL's timer function, glutTimerFunc, which
ensures the smooth and consistent movement of the snake and other game objects.
The vehicle's animation is achieved by updating its position and redrawing the
game objects at regular intervals, creating the illusion of continuous motion.
